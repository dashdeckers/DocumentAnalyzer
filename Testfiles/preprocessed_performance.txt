PREFACE TO 1850 EDITION  I do not find it easy to get sufficiently far away from this Book, in the first aensations of having, fisished it, to refer to it with the compose which this formal heading wonld acem to roquire. My interest in it, is so rocent md strong, md my mind is so divided between pleasure and ropret— pleamre in the achievement of a long design, regret in the acparation ftom many companions—that I am in danger of wearying the reader whom I loye, with personal confidences, and private emotions.  Besides which, all that I conld say of the Story, to my purpose, [have endeavoured to say init.  Ti.wonld concern the reader little, perhaps, to know, how sorrowfilly the pen ia laid down at the close of a two-yesra’ imaginative task; or how an Author fecls as if he were dismissing some portion of himself into the shadowy world, when a crowd of the creatures of hia brain are going ftom him for ever. Yet, [have nothing clae to tell; unless, indsed, I were to confess (which might be of less moment ati) that no one eam over believe this Narrative, in the reading, more than I haye believed it in the writing,  Instead of looking back, therefore, I will look forward. I camot close this Volume more agreeably to myself, than with a hopeful glance towards the time when I shall again pnt forth my two green leaves once a month, and with a fuithil remembrance of the genial am and showers that have fallen on these leaves of David Copperfield, md made me happy.
