PREFACE TO 1850 EDITION  I do not find it easy to get sufficiently far sway from this Book, in the first aensations of having, fixished it, to refer to it with the composnre which this formal heading wonld acem to roquire. My interest in it, is so rocent md strong, md my mind ia so divided between pleasure and ropret— pleamre in the achievement of a long design, regret in the acparation ftom many companions—that I am in danger of wearying the reader whom I love, with personal confidences, and private emotions.  Besides which, all that I conld say of the Story, to my purpose, [have endeavoured to say init.  Tt wonld concern the reader little, perhaps, to know, how sorrowfully the pen is laid down at the close of a two-yeara’ imaginative task; or how an Author fecls as if he were dismissing some portion of himself into the shadowy world, when a crowd of the creatures of hia brain are going ftom him for over. Yet, [have nothing clae to tell; unless, indsed, I were to confess (which might be of less moment ail) that no one eam over believe this Narrative, in the reading, more than I have believed it in the writing,  Instead of looking back, therefore, I will look forward. I camot close this Volume more agreeably to myself, thn with a hopeful glance towards the time when I shall again pnt forth my two green leaves once a month, and with a faith remembrance of the genial am and showers that haye fallen on these leaves of David Copperfield, md made me happy.
